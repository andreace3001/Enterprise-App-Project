## Introduction
It is hard to stay focused on your tasks with so many distractions in this world. People tend to forget what they want to get done. With our application we plan to organize the lives of our users so they can organize their tasks. A user can plan out their day, their week and important tasks. We plan to make our application simple and easy on the eye for our users.
